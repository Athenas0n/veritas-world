        </div>
        <img class="articleImage" src="../../src/images/who_anti-science_aggression">
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">The World Health Organisation (WHO) released a video about “anti-vaccine activism,” suggesting that “misinformation” surrounding vaccines is more deadly than “gun violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyber attacks.” 
            The video starts by claiming that “200,000 Americans needlessly lost their lives because they refused the Covid vaccine,” and calls “anti-science aggression” a global expanding “killing force.”</p>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">Something that the WHO does not seem to acknowledge in this video is the fact that people have a right to choose. Many would agree that vaccine hesitancy is, in most cases, due to a lack of faith in governments and pharmaceutical companies, 
            rather than being politically fuelled as “anti-science aggression.” I am not against vaccines myself; I have had the first two doses and a booster - 
            however people should have a right to weigh up the pros and cons (and there are issues with the vaccine, something else the WHO failed to mention) of having a vaccine, without being labelled a terrorist.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h2>What the WHO Doesn't Mention</h2>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">
            If the WHO really wants to reduce vaccine hesitancy, then they should perhaps focus on making data on the vaccines more transparent, 
            as Robert Kaplan and Sander Greenland explore. They published a study suggesting that the risks of COVID-19 vaccines may be greater than previously reported. 
            Using publicly available data from Pfizer and Moderna studies, they found “one serious event for each 800 vaccines.
             That translates to about 1,250 serious events for every million vaccine recipients.” The DHHS reports the rate for other vaccines as only 1 or 2 per million. 
             Kaplan and Greenland note that “analysis might harm public heath by stimulating more vaccine hesitancy.
             Yet if some concerns are valid, remaining quiet could also result in harm and further erode public trust in science.”
        </p>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">
            It is important to consider this statistic in the context of other vaccines. 
            As Kaplan and Greenland state, “The 1976 swine flu vaccine was withdrawn after it was associated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome at a rate of approximately 1 in 100,000. 
            In 1999, the rotavirus vaccine Rotashield was withdrawn following reports of intussusception in about 1 or 2 in 10,000.” 
        </p>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">While it is widely acknowledged that COVID-19 vaccines do help prevent hospitalisations, 
            these seem to be mostly concentrated in those whom already have chronic illnesses. For those who do not, the effectiveness is less clear.
             This is where I believe there is good in weighing up the pros and cons of the vaccine. You may have very little risk of severe illness from COVID-19, 
             but could still have a severe reaction to the vaccine.
        </p>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">
            Kaplan and Greenland also note that their study would have been better if it had not been hindered by a certain addressable problem: 
            “The individual level data that could confirm or refute our analysis have not been made public. For example, we would have greater confidence in our conclusions if we knew how often individuals experienced multiple serious adverse events.
             Pfizer, Moderna and the FDA have these data, but have kept them hidden from public view. This information is essential to the understanding of the balance between vaccine benefits and harms.”
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="articleParagraphs">The WHO seems very quick to label those who exercise their freedom of choosing whether or not they have a medical procedure as worse than global terrorists. 
            In an ideal world having a rational conversation about the very real potential reactions to the vaccine alongside their benefits should be encouraged, 
            however it seems transparency and freedom of choice are not something that governments and large unelected bodies like the WHO are interested in.</p>
